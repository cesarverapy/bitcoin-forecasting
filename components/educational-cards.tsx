              <CardTitle>The Power Law Formula</CardTitle>
              <CardDescription>Understanding the mathematical model behind Bitcoin&apos;s price growth</CardDescription>
            </CardHeader>
            <CardContent className="space-y-4">
              <p>The Power Law model for Bitcoin&apos;s price is based on the formula:</p>
              <div className="bg-secondary/50 rounded-lg p-4 text-center">
                <p className="text-lg font-mono">price = A Ã— (days^B)</p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Think of this formula like a growth pattern that Bitcoin has followed since its creation. It&apos;s similar to how cities grow - they start small and grow faster at first, then slow down but keep growing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where <span className="font-mono">A</span> and <span className="font-mono">B</span> are constants
                derived from historical data, and <span className="font-mono">days</span> is the number of days since
                the Bitcoin genesis block (January 3, 2009).
              </p>
              <p>
                This model suggests that Bitcoin&apos;s price growth follows a power law relationship with time, rather
                than an exponential one. This means the rate of growth slows over time, but still continues upward.
              </p>
              <p>
                The power law relationship has been observed in many natural and economic systems, from the distribution
                of wealth to the growth of cities.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-secondary/50 rounded-lg p-4 mt-4">
                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Think of it Like This:</h4>
                <p>Imagine Bitcoin&apos;s price like a tree growing. When it&apos;s young, it grows very quickly. As it gets older, it still grows but at a slower pace. The Power Law helps us understand this natural growth pattern.</p>

                The Power Law model has shown remarkable accuracy in predicting Bitcoin&apos;s long-term price
                trajectory, despite short-term volatility.

                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">What This Means for You:</h4>
                <p>Think of the Power Law like a long-term trend line. While Bitcoin&apos;s price can jump up and down in the short term (like waves on the ocean), it tends to follow this overall growth pattern over time.</p>

                While short-term price movements can deviate significantly from the model (up to 300% above or 50%
                below), Bitcoin&apos;s price has historically returned to the model line over time.

                <p>Even though Bitcoin&apos;s price can swing wildly in the short term, it has consistently followed this growth pattern over the long term, making it a useful tool for understanding Bitcoin&apos;s overall price direction.</p>
